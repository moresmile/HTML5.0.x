Then: begin was thin and small
On 11.11.1998, google page named "Welcome to Google" has two simple text lines with hyperlink and no images (att. 1)
After clicking on first link, you was redirected to google search page, under patronage of Stanford university, named and linked to http://google.stanford.edu (att. 2).
After clicking on second link, you was redirected on beta version of searching web page, named http://alpha.google.com (att. 3).
Also, very nice and interesting is first welcoming message to google-friends newsletter list,  from Larry(att. 4)

Now: today on 01.02.2019, we have "left over" of simplicity, with added one input box for text or optional speech search and submitting buttons on first page(att.5)
